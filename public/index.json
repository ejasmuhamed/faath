[{"content":"🔥 Delete ALL songs or movies or drama from your devices [social media accounts -reels, youtube videos etc] RIGHT NOW, without any delay or second thought. YOU WILL NOT LOSE ANYTHING! Instead you will feel like you’ve accomplished something or as its first step.\n🔥 Say الحمدلله and dua to الله help you with this change. Without Him we can’t even move a finger. So make sincere repentance and dua.\n🔥 DON’T replace it with Nasheeds. It’s not permissible too since it’s an imitation of music. Trying to make something halal out of haram doesn’t work.Just because it contains lyrics of about الله or prophet doesn’t makes it halal/permissible.\n🔥 Also replacing it with podcasts of social media muftis and deviants scholars or random brothers podcasts claiming “islamic stuffs” also not gonna benefit you. You can hear podcasts of authentic scholars of Ahlul Qura’n wa Al Sunnah if it’s available. Or hear podcasts of other beneficial topics that you might need in your life/career. But don’t get too addicted too since a podcast is a very time consuming thing. Just be conscious in whatever you do that’s it.\n🔥 Mute reels or shorts on Ytube / insta etc if you’re using these apps.\n🔥 Don’t watch videos with music in it which includes short films, movies, drama etc because that will not help you with quitting music or in any way\n🔥 Change your ringtone/caller tune to simple sound which is already on phone. Don’t put songs as ringtone.\n🔥 Surround yourself with practising muslim friends. If you don’t have one find one or dua to الله to show you one. Because if your friends use music or are haram lunatics you’re most likely to use/do/follow it too. If your friends ain’t helping you change, cut those friends out. YES. Say bye bye 👋الله will bless you with good friends if you ask for it.\n🔥 Don’t pose for reels with your cousins and friends if they’re asking you to do it for fun. Because it is NOT FUN. It’s a sin/ Haram.\n🔥 Know why we do salah, fast and all our Ibadah. It’s also to keep us away from doing sins. If we keep doing haram/sinning then we are doing all wrong and it’s not benefiting us.\n🔥 Don’t attend any kind of programs with music being played there. Yes. This includes your college programs, parties, weddings etc.\n🔥 If you’re a person praying, fasting, reading Quran daily but still you can’t find peace, then check your sins/ bad habits that you’re doing consciously and unconsciously. Because sins prevent us to experience the sweetness of our ibadah. Also Quran and Music (Haram) will not go in parallel period!\n🔥 Don’t come to argue or even think about debating with the benefits of music , because there is no such thing ! Music will slowly eats your mind and suck the peace out of it. If you’re clinically depressed/anxious/chronically stressed or having any mental issues \u0026amp; wonder why you’re having it or isn’t healing even after taking treatment both spiritually \u0026amp; through modern science, then this music/haram/sins is one of the reasons behind it. That’s the reason why you feel irritated or don’t feel peace when you listen to Qura’n unlike when you hear music and enjoy it.\n🔥 Play Qura’n in your home. Don’t watch movies etc at home too. Use that same speaker you used to play music/haram, now to hear Qura’n and to earn good إن شاء الله.\n🔥 Play Qura’n in car while travelling and when you do workouts at gym or home.\n🔥 Good habits are hard to build up. You will feel like relapsing . When you hear a song, shaytan will tempt you and you will be like “may be I should check which song is that🤔” “lemme hear only for once! “ NO. JUST DON’T. Instead stay strong and make your dua stronger! Don’t blame shaytan it’s our choice that we choose to sin. Shaytan will only tempt us. And if we fall for it, we sin.\n🔥 Enroll to learn Qura’n whether it’s Tajweed, hifdh, or Tafseer because just quitting a bad habit doesn’t stay longer chances of relapse is high so what works is replacing a bad habit with good habits.\n","permalink":"/posts/tips-to-quit-music/","summary":"🔥 Delete ALL songs or movies or drama from your devices [social media accounts -reels, youtube videos etc] RIGHT NOW, without any delay or second thought.
