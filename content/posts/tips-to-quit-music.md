_Today again I was at a cafe with my husband and I started to work on my journal. As usual, they were playing music. So I took AirPods out and put it on and played one of my favourite Surah on repeat. This is how I avoid music in public places. Since many of our Muslim brothers and sisters are struggling with music, thought I would share some practical tips from my personal experience that you can adopt in life to quit/avoid music. So listing some below إن شاء الله :_



-   Delete ALL songs, movies or drama from your devices [social media accounts -reels, YouTube videos etc] RIGHT NOW, without any delay or second thought. YOU WILL NOT LOSE ANYTHING! Instead, you will feel like you’ve accomplished something or as its first step.


-   Say الحمدلله and dua to الله help you with this change. Without HIM, we can’t even move a finger. So make sincere repentance and dua.


-   Don’t replace it with Nasheeds. It’s not permissible too since it’s an imitation of music. Trying to make something halal out of haram doesn’t work. Just because it contains lyrics of about الله or prophet doesn’t make it halal/permissible.


-   Also replacing it with podcasts of social media muftis and deviant scholars or random brothers podcasts claiming “Islamic stuff” also not gonna benefit you. You can hear podcasts of authentic scholars of Ahlul Qura’n wa Al-Sunnah if it’s available. Or hear podcasts of other beneficial topics that you might need in your life/career. But don’t get too addicted too since a podcast is a very time-consuming thing. Just be conscious in whatever you do that’s it.


-   Mute reels or shorts on YouTube / Instagram etc if you’re using these apps.


-   Don’t watch videos with music in them which includes short films, movies, drama etc because that will not help you with quitting music or in any way


-   Change your ringtone/caller tune to a simple sound which is already on the phone. Don’t put songs as ringtone.


-   Surround yourself with practising Muslim friends. If you don’t have one find one or dua to الله to show you one. Because if your friends use music or are haram lunatics you’re most likely to use/do/follow it too. If your friends ain’t helping you change, cut those friends out. YES. Say bye bye 👋 الله will bless you with good friends if you ask for it.


-   Don’t pose for reels with your cousins and friends if they’re asking you to do it for fun. Because it is NOT FUN. It’s a sin/ Haram.


-   Know why we do Salah, fast and all our Ibadah. It’s also to keep us away from doing sins. If we keep doing haram/sinning then we are doing all wrong and it’s not benefiting us.


-   Don’t attend any kind of programs with music being played there. Yes. This includes your college programs, parties, weddings etc.


-   If you’re a person praying, fasting, and reading the Quran daily but still can’t find peace, then check your sins/ bad habits that you’re doing consciously and unconsciously. Because sins prevent us from experiencing the sweetness of our Ibadah. Also, Quran and Music (Haram) will not go in parallel, period.


-   Don’t come to argue or even think about debating the benefits of music, because there is no such thing! Music will slowly eat your mind and suck the peace out of it. If you’re clinically depressed/anxious/chronically stressed or having any mental issues & wonder why you’re having it or isn’t healing even after taking treatment both spiritually & through modern science, then this music/haram/sins is one of the reasons behind it. That’s the reason why you feel irritated or don’t feel peace when you listen to Qur’an unlike when you hear music and enjoy it.


-   Play Qura’n in your home. Don’t watch movies etc at home too. Use that same speaker you used to play music/haram, now to hear the Qur’an and to earn good إن شاء الله.


-   Play Qura’n in the car while travelling and when you do workouts at the gym or home.


-   Good habits are hard to build up. You will feel like relapsing. When you hear a song, Shaytan will tempt you and you will be like “Maybe I should check which song is that 🤔” “lemme hear only for once! “ NO. JUST DON’T. Instead, stay strong and make your dua stronger! Don’t blame Shaytan it’s our choice that we choose to sin. Shaytan will only tempt us. And if we fall for it, we sin.


-   Enrol in learning Qura’n whether it’s Tajweed, Hifdh, or Tafseer because just quitting a bad habit doesn’t stay longer chances of relapse are high so what works is replacing a bad habit with good habits.


-   Learn about Tawheed and make our Aqeedah stronger and learn about الله’s Names & Attributes too.

_Shaitan takes the person in stages, step by step until he destroys him._

_Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-'Uthaymeen (rahimahullah) stated:_

_The Shaytaan wants the children of Aadam to stray with a far-straying and not a near straying (one that’s close to the truth)._

_Allaah stated: “And the Shaytaan wants to lead them far astray.” However, we are not to think that the Shaytaan commands (the people) with (going) far astray from the onset. Rather (he does it) in stages. So he commands with Fisq (corruption) and the lesser acts of disobedience. Then (he commands with) the major sins. Then (he commands with) the disbelief (in Allaah). We ask Allaah to protect us._

_Based upon this the ‘Ulamaa have said: The acts of disobedience are the Bareed (path) to al-Kufr…The scholars have mentioned that the acts of disobedience are the path to al-Kufr and the Shaytaan takes the person in stages, step by step until the point he destroys him.”_

_[Taken from: Tafseer Soorah an-Nisaa V. 1 Pg. 475-476 \ Translated by Abu Yusuf Khaleefah]_

_May الله help us all and keep us steadfast on deen آمين_
